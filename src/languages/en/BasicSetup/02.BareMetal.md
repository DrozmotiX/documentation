# Bare Metal

<**ToDo**>

ioBroker will be installed directly on top of the operating system (preferable linux) without additional logic layers.

* Pro's

    * A quite easy setup if you already have the operating system running

    * Except the operating system and ioBroker, no additional knowledge needed to maintain the system

* Con's

    * Not as flexible as visualisation

    * All processes and additional applications run on the same System

    * Security, all applications share the same host in case one is Vulnerable all services/applications are affected
