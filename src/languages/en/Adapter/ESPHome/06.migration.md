# Tasmota / ESPEasy migraion

Migrating from previous Sonoff Tasmota or ESPEasy setups is very easy. You just need to have ESPHome create a binary for you and then upload that in the web interface.

## Download Binary
::: tip
First follow the guides [My First Device](./04.myFirstDevice.md) and create a configuration file. Then, generate and download the binary:

## Upload Binary
To upload the binary, navigate to the Tasmota/ESPEasy web interface

## Tasmota

Enter the "Firmware Upgrade" section.

<img src="./img/tasmota_main.png" width="60%" height="60%" align="center">

In the "Upgrade by file upload" section, choose the binary you previously downloaded

<img src="./img/tasmota_ota.png" width="60%" height="60%" align="center">

If everything succeeds, you will see an "Upload Successful" message and ESPHome
will connect to the WiFi network configured in your .yaml file. ðŸŽ‰

::: warning
When using the `esp8266_pwm output </components/output/esp8266_pwm>` platform and
switching from Tasmota, you need to power-cycle the device once. After that
the dimming functionality will work as usual and no more power cycles are required.
:::

::: tip
If you are using Tasmota 8+ and get an error after uploading the firmware, go to the console and type ```SetOption78 1```, then restart the device and try the firmware again.

### ESPEasy

Enter the "Tools " section.

Press "Load" under Firmware, then select the binary you previously downloaded and upload
the binary. If everything succeeds, you should now have ESPHome on your node ðŸŽ‰.

::: tip
with ESPHome, you in most cases won't need to worry about the available flash size, as
the binary only ever includes the code that you are actually using.
